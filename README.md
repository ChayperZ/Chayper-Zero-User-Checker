## ⚠️ Current Status and Known Limitations

We are dedicated to maintaining high performance. Please note the current operational status based on username length:

| Status | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **4-Character Usernames and Above** | Working **perfectly** and reliably (100% operational). |
| **3-Character Usernames Only** | **Currently non-operational** due to an internal bug that is actively being worked on. |

> **Developer Note:** We apologize for any inconvenience regarding 3-character usernames. A fix will be rolled out in an upcoming update!
